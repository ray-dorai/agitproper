Movies, books, papers, music and tv are much of how we learn about the world. This is because stories are much of how we learn about the world. Learning in humans is possible through learning from what people we think are cool. This is how we have people who can fly, people who can talk to each other in seconds around the world, make lots of food for so many people, and how we put robots on Mars. We remember things as a group, and over many, many years we use the things we remember from past people's lives to build new things. People say our brains are just big, and sure, they are big- but as just one animal, apes do about as well as we do. What makes us very smart is that we think together, like bees.

<p>
What lets us figure out what to learn is our way of learning from cool people. There are two ways we listen to people: one is when they are cool, and the other is when they are forcing us because they are stronger than us. In the past, cool people were people who helped the group do many things. They were good at getting food, good at taking care of people, and good at stopping people from fighting. By looking for the cool people, we could figure out who would have good things to learn from- things that helped our groups live in a not-safe world. Cool people were cool because they were good at helping groups live. As a child, you might learn from a cool hunter because you think you might be in a sort-of-same place to the hunter one day, or you might learn from a cool weaver because you might think you would be in a sort-of-same place to the weaver one day. When you were bored learning from one, you would find another. Adults arenâ€™t so different.

Strong people who force you to do things can get things done, but over time we don't like this, especially if we know about it. So while we learn how to fight them, we do not learn from them as much as we learn from people we think are  cool. Our schools kind of work like strong people who force things. They tell us what to do and how to do it and they act like they may hurt us when we don't do it, so we do what they say but at the end of the day we follow what we think is cool. This is why most people forget the things they learned in school, and such. They do not forget things from their favorite movies or story books.

Once, the cool people in your world were in your village. You could know them, and they could know you. Now the cool people in your world are very far away, and are mostly parts of stories. You may try to learn from them, but it is not the same as having someone in front of you that you can follow- someone you can learn from, and someone who will learn from you because you are learning from them.

<p>
This leads to some interesting ends. First, what is cool is not as tied to what works to live well in a not-safe world. Second, people make facts from what the people they think are cool say and do. Third, people learn to do things that make for good stories, rather than things that work for living well in a not-safe world. Living in a not-safe world teaches people to be safe. Living in a safe world teaches people to be not-safe.
<p>
Take soldiers in a movie. They may not agree a lot in a way that hurts their mission. They may yell at each other over very small things. This kind of thing would get a soldier killed, so it would not happen as much in very good units. Yet, our movies show us that this is what good units do- so if people are ever in a not-safe time, they may pretend to be like the people they see in these movies.
<p>
Take a couple in a movie. They may not agree on some things, until the boy does something to make the girl feel good about him. It may be that he moves across the land to see her, or fills her office with roses. Then she is nice to him and he is nice to her and the movie makes us think they will always be like this. This kind of thing sets people to think that relationships are not made of many tiny choices that are always happening. If they do not get this nice picture at the end, they may make some loud moves so that the other person will do something big to make them feel good. This will slow them down if they are ever in a not-safe world.
<p>
People agree on facts by doing as the biggest groups of cool people in their worlds do. Someone can be cool in one world and not-cool in another. For some time, people agreed on facts because cool people all listened to what they agreed about in the newspapers and from their teachers. Now, this is happening less, because we have more facts than ever before. We get more new facts every day. People are not sure about what is fact and not fact because they do not agree on who is the coolest. They fight each other with words, and try to get others to agree on what is a fact and what is not a fact. If people do not agree with their fact, they attack them with words.
<p>
We will show that everyone is cool, because we will need all the facts to deal with a not-safe world, if the world ever becomes not-safe again. We will do this by making stories that show how there is a fact behind every not-fact, and how it is cool for people to win in a not-safe world.

 To show how everyone is cool Now, <a href="what.html">make stuff that shows how everyone is cool</a>.
