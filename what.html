  When you create something for Agitproper, simply ask: <b>will this help whoever sees or hears this win in a not-safe world one day?</b> 
  If the answer is 'Yes', it's perfect for Agitproper.  
  Imagine a disaster. A tsunami. A hurricane. A nuclear holocaust. Someone getting thrown out of a community. Now imagine what it would be like to have people who are competent responding and creating in the face of this disaster. Imagine their faces- some serene, some grimaced in the extreme, some grinning in pain, but also full of wonder with hints of joy. The joy of focusing, of getting lost in the task at hand and creating life where all hope was lost- whether that's to pull someone out of a burning building or to offer a hand in support after a long day of demeaning work. We want what we make to help people feel this feeling, whenever they need it. To overcome, whenever they need it. To expand, take risks, and explore, whenever they need it. To flourish, whenever we all need to flourish.

  All we're going to need is <b>25 projects</b> (and we're at 3) - that's enough to show people what our world could look like-<p>
